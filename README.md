## Bash Roulette Wheel

### This is a version of the roulette wheel, you can only bet on a single number, and also the number is chosen at random, to run the command first if the roulette.sh is not an executable when you clone the repository, run the command `chmod +x roulette.sh` on the file then run `./roulette.sh` if your file is not in the $PATH variable
